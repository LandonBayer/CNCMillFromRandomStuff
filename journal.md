## **5/25/2025 Log 1: Initial Concepts**

I began by trying to figure out if this is even possible. To get my ideas flowing, I made a quick Google doc with each part of the CNC as I thought of them and explained how I would fulfill that requirement: either with parts I have or links to a cheap option I could use.

I set up this repo, made an Onshape document, and my research document above. I'm doing my best to fit into the $150 price tag to avoid the extra bar for $350 funding, but I may apply for it as necessary in the future. It would certainly be a huge upgrade to the machine, but the goal is a minimum functioning product for as little as possible. 

I'm looking to follow a basic CNC configuration with the spindle moving in XZ and the bed in Y, much like a bedslinger 3D printer or a 3018 style CNC.  

Time Spent: 45 Minutes (mostly research)

Some parts are not in my house at this exact moment so I need to wait a few days to go and grab them. In the meantime, I'll try to design most of the printer and be able to swap out the CAD models as I get the real ones and create/find models for them.

It is also worth noting that I have access to an Omio CNC router through my robotics team, which will enable me to make custom parts in aluminum or polycarbonate as I please (though I may have to buy stock as part of my budget). I also recently set up a 4th axis on it, so I can even do some more complex parts too.

Here are some sources of inspiration:
